Define a ray as:
	Rorigin == Ro == [Xo Yo Zo]
	Rctirection == Rct == [Xct Yct Zct]
	where Xa + Ya + Za = 1 (i.e. normalized)
	which defines a ray as :

set of points on line R (t ) = Ro + Rct * t, where t > 0 . 

Points on the line where t < 0 are behind the ray's origin. Why t = 0 i s not
included as a point on the ray is explained in the ' Precision Problems' section.
Note that the ray direction does not have to be normalized for these
calculations . However, such normalization is recommended, otherwise t will
represent the distance in terms of the length of the direction vector.
Normalizing the direction vector once for the ray before intersection testing ensures that t will equal the distance from the ray's origin in terms of world
coordinates.
Equation (A 1 ) is the parametric or explicit form of the ray equation . This
means that all the points on the ray can be generated directly by varying the
value of t.

The sphere is defined by:
	Sphere 's center == Sc == [Xc Yc Zc]
	Sphere 's radius == Sr
	Sphere's surface is the set of points [Xs Ys Zsl

where (Xs - Xc ) 2 + ( Ys - Yc ) 2 + (Zs - Zc ) 2 = Sr^2.

(A2)
The sphere's surface is expressed as an implicit equation . In this form points
on the surface cannot be directly generated . Instead, each point [Xs Ys Zs]
can be tested by the implicit equation ; if it fulfdls the equation's conditions,
the point is on the surface.
To solve the intersection problem, the ray equation is substituted into the
sphere equation and the result is solved for t. This is done by expressing the
ray equation (A1 ) as a set of equations for the set of points [X Y Z] in terms of
t:
X = Xo + Xd • t
Y = Yo + Yd • t
Z = Zo + Zd * t.
(A3)
Substituting this set of equations into the sphere equation's variables
[Xs Ys Zs] , we obtain :
( 


r(intersect) == r(i) = [xi, yi, Zi] = [Xo + Xct * t, Yo + Yct * t, Zo + Zct * t] . 
where:
	xi = Xo + Xct * t
	yi = Yo + Yct * t
	zi = Zo + Zct * t
